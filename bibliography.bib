abstract = {For centuries, anecdotal evidence such as the perfect pitch of the blind piano tuner or blind musician has supported the notion that individuals who have lost their sight early in life have superior hearing abilities compared with sighted people. Recently, auditory psychophysical and functional imaging studies have identified that specific auditory enhancements in the early blind can be linked to activation in extrastriate visual cortex, suggesting crossmodal plasticity. Furthermore, the nature of the sensory reorganization in occipital cortex supports the concept of a task-based functional cartography for the cerebral cortex rather than a sensory-based organization. In total, studies of early-blind individuals provide valuable insights into mechanisms of cortical plasticity and principles of cerebral organization.}

	abstract = {Functional imaging studies in blind subjects have shown tactile activation of cortical areas that normally subserve vision, but whether blind people have enhanced tactile acuity has long been controversial. We compared the passive tactile acuity of blind and sighted subjects on a fully automated grating orientation task and used multivariate Bayesian data analysis to determine predictors of acuity. Acuity was significantly superior in blind subjects, independently of the degree of childhood vision, light perception level, or Braille reading. Acuity was strongly dependent on the force of contact between the stimulus surface and the skin, declined with subject age, and was better in women than in men. Despite large intragroup variability, the difference between blind and sighted subjects was highly significant: the average blind subject had the acuity of an average sighted subject of the same gender but 23 years younger. The results suggest that crossmodal plasticity may underlie tactile acuity enhancement in blindness.},

abstract="A movable dynamic tactile display has been developed presenting information to one or several fingertips resting on the display. As a main goal, the virtual line or plane of information to be displayed should be read using the same perceptual and cognitive resources as with real objects like paper braille or tactile graphics. This is achieved by a nonvibratory display comprising an array of tactile pins having a spacing of about 1 mm, at least in the x-direction. These pins can be lifted by piezoelectric bending strips to a variety of heights. A scanned braille dot, for example, is presented by a smooth lateral ``wave'' of lifted and lowered pins. A special design resulting in a negligible power dissipation even at high bandwidth allows the integration of the bending strip drivers into the display mechanics. First experiences with a prototype are reported, and future research topics are outlined.",
